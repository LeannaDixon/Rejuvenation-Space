    <p> After spending three years working in the NHS (National Health Service,) volunteering as a Health and Wellbeing Champion and freelancing as a Mobile Massage Therapist, our founder, Keana Aitcheson, noticed high levels of muscle tension and general stress in clients across the board. Many of her colleagues in the office also had similar issues to her massage clients – they complained about general pains, aches, tension, headaches and high stress.

However, after providing a simple 10 minute massage, their symptoms were relieved and they became empowered to complete their remaining work day.

After reviewing the National Health Service statistics, Keana found a large number of staff absences was due to mental and musculoskeletal work-related illness.

This all inspired here to help, by education about the importance of self-care and by preventing these conditions. She noticed that impactful massage treatments were not readily affordable or accessible in an office workspace, so decided to bring the treatment, to you.

That’s why we created The Rejuvenation Space, to make quality on-site massage for self-care and workplace balance more accessible and affordable for all employees!
